# ddns-client

I am making ddns-client because I needed a DDNS client that I trusted. The ones that I do trust are either too much of a hassle to setup on all platforms or used the old API global key for Cloudflare.

There are other projects, that I am certain are great or better than this one, but I also wanted to make my own as an expiriment.

The project currently has no release as I am still developing the mvp feature set.
